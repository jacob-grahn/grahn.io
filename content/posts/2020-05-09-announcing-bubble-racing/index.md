This is very much still a WIP at this point, but it does vaugly resemble a game. I'm trying to get things out sooner, even if they are not perfect (or done).

Hope you enjoy. If you're interested in contributing or just learning, the source code for the game is available on [github](https://github.com/jacob-grahn/bubble-racing)
