Lately I've been thinking about how to move forward with the Platform Racing series without abandoning its long history and dedicated community.

I just uploaded Platform Racing 2's multiplayer server to a [public repo](https://github.com/jacob-grahn/platform-racing-2-server). Some of it is cringeworthy and embarrasing, but oh well! The code is a decode old! Github will probably do a better job at preserving the files than I can, and this creates a new opportunity for PR2 to grow and improve.

If you have been waiting all this time to contribute to PR2, then now you finally can. Contributions are very welcome. :)

I am currently working on a project called Platform Racing Forever. I'll write more on that later!
